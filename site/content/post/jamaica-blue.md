  SEO is a tricky subject, however, because of the tight-lipped nature of search
  engines While Google has revealed some of the factors it uses to determine
  where websites rank, it has not shown its exact algorithm. Of course, this
  shouldn’t come as a surprise. If Google disclosed Its ranking algorithm,
  webmasters would know how to manipulate their search rankings. There are still
  ways to encourage higher search rankings, and that’s the basis of SEO. It
  involves building back links on relevant and authoritative websites, as well
  as publishing high-quality content and performing other on-page optimization
  processes.
